# 📈 Client Sales Effectiveness & Product Performance Analysis

This project analyzes client sales data to evaluate product performance, sales agent effectiveness, and lead distribution by location. It includes detailed visualizations and classification models to draw meaningful business insights.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Analyze product-wise sales volume and revenue
- Evaluate sales agent performance metrics
- Visualize lead distribution by location
- Build predictive models to classify successful sales

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for advanced plotting)

## 📊 Visualizations Included
The project uses multiple advanced plotting techniques to reveal patterns and comparisons:
- *Stacked Bar Plot*
- *Grouped Bar Plot*
- *Scatter Plot*
- *Box Plot & Violin Plot*
- *Bubble Plot*
- *Line Plot*
- *Pair Plot*

These visualizations help in identifying trends across products, agents, and geography.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Created new features from existing data to enhance model accuracy

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
A variety of classification models were trained and compared:
- *Random Forest Classifier*
- *Logistic Regression*
- *Support Vector Classifier (SVC)*
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
- *Decision Tree Classifier*
- *Gradient Boosting Classifier*

Model performance was evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## 📌 Results
- Identified high-performing products by category
- Mapped lead distributions across regions
- Ranked sales agents based on volume and success rate
- Gradient Boosting and Random Forest performed best in classification tasks
